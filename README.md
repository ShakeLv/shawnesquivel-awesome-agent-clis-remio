## Quickstart: Give Your Agent 1000+ Tools

The Composio CLI lets agents search, authenticate, and execute tools across 1000+ apps from the terminal.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://composio.dev/install | bash
composio login
composio search "star a github repo"
composio execute GITHUB_STAR_A_REPOSITORY_FOR_THE_AUTHENTICATED_USER -d '{"owner":"composiohq","repo":"composio"}'
```

Get your API key at [platform.composio.dev](https://platform.composio.dev/?utm_source=Github&utm_content=AwesomeAgentCLIs)

## What Makes a CLI Agent-Ready?

Not every CLI is built with agents in mind. The 🤖 badge marks CLIs that were **explicitly designed** for AI agent use. Common traits:

| Trait                                              | Why it matters                                |
| -------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Structured output (`--json`)                       | Agents parse JSON, not ASCII tables           |
| Non-interactive mode (`--no-interactive`, `--yes`) | Agents can't answer prompts                   |
| API key auth (`--key`, env vars)                   | No browser OAuth dance                        |
| Idempotency keys                                   | Agents can safely retry on failure            |
| Piped output detection                             | Auto-switches from pretty to machine-readable |
| Meaningful exit codes                              | Agents need to branch on success/failure      |

CLIs without the 🤖 badge are **established tools that work well with agents** thanks to structured output, scriptability, or good defaults.
